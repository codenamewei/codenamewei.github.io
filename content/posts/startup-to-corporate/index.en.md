## Introduction

The last few years has been a roller coaster ride. A year ago, I stepped away from a technology startup and entered a corporate which started back in 1923 (which marks 100 years in the coming 2023!).

{{< admonition >}} Both companies are in the field of data science realm, which is acknowledged by many people as a still-evolving industry. {{< /admonition >}}

Being in the fast-paced of technology field, changes is the norm and embracing changes is the only way in moving forward.

With a year of milestone after the transition, this article details the learning from the transition. Essentially, this post attempts to details the observations of both entities, keeping it as general towards companies of the similar nature as possible.

## The Analogy

Joining a company is very much like getting on board on a boat(startup) or a ship(established corporate). Each vessel heading towards one direction at one time, with crew members onboard playing a role in contributing towards the common goal.

## 1. Problem of the same nature, but different spectrum

The spectrum of the chaos lies in the number of holes you have to fix at one time.

**The Boat(The Start Up)**

Continue from the analogy raised, being at a startup can felt like being at a boat with multiple holes at the same time. The ability to prioritize which hole to fix will decide whether the ship will stay afloat or sink into the deep blue sea. Everyday is a whole new day to reprioritize and weigh which problem is more worth-solving.

If you are an independent contributor, it ranges either to solve an existing bug or develop a new feature. If you are a team lead, it can be a presentation for a potential lead at 2 hours away or deciding the roadmap of the software development. If you are at a position of wearing multiple hats, which is very common in a startup, all of those hustles are on your plate.

On some days, there are simply no options given that a problem has to solved at that particular moment. You simply have to drop everything else on your hands and attend to it. Example: an employee indicates that he is quitting, a bidding proposal is due, single point of failure in a system, etc.

**The Ship(The Established Corporate)**

Contrary to that, being on a ship which has stays afloat for decades and experienced countless number of tides, the number of holes of to fix at each time is relatively lesser. This is ultimately the differences between a startup and an established corporate. Most importantly, the buisness is at the stage of financial stability with consistent Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).

With the capital to expand and scale, departments and diversifying roles have been formed over the years to address different sets of concerns. Employees at the corporate have developed best known methods to tackle previously faced problems. New hires went through sessions of knowledge transfer to pick up skills needed to get work done. With prior knowledge, resources and skillful teams, the impacts of setbacks are reduces extensively.

If it's not already obvious, both startup and established are of the similar nature. The differences one might experience in a startup or an well-established corporate is just a matter of different spectrum, but not a total different set of reality.

The same problem occurs in startup occurs in a corporate, the difference fundamentally narrows down towards are you the person handling it. It might be out of sight become it is covered by other teams which you are not aware of due to the silo organizational structure , or quickly regrouped and settled between some core members due to how the same hiccup has appeared before.

## 2. Changes are bound to happen.

<context>

**The Ship(The Established Corporate)**

Reorganization still happening, business changes especially with internal and external factors.

Internally, talent retention never gets easy, as clever people leave the company due to lack of opportunity to shine by working on high-profile projects or relate daily works to company's vision.

Externally, Covid disruptions (2019-2021) and the new norms of post-Covid (2022 onwards) shifts the focus of the company and directly impact the priorities of projects.

What might be different is the magnitude of the impact and how people in the pool identify it at different paces. For example, people of corporate would able to foreseen problem at an earlier stage, and come collectively to either mitigate or solve the problem. The reason partly, if not all, when shit hits the fan, it's **shared accountability** and everybody gets affected. The impact might varies from getting a red card for performance review to how teams being dispensed due to the lost of projects.

The point is, problems of similar natures will keep on happening. At a point where you might wonder, did any company ever get this rights? Did any company able to build an stabil structure which only focuses on problems that worth solving?

## Final Word

Culture build from top down, never the other around. When the right leadership team has been build, it's all in the details to cascade to middle management team and build the right message to convey. It also does means that if you are at a place where you find that your beliefs, your daily way of working are largely different from the company's vision, it will be nearly impossible for you to create an overhaul to company's culture that goes through all tiers.

To build a company which lasts, you need a leadership team who cares for the right cause and business continues to evolve with market dynamics. The latter include identify market needs in advance, build good products, and build the positioning to right crowd.

The exciting portion of a startup is due to it still at it's defining stage. This ultimately it shows more potentials (and more risks) in either becoming a unicorn or shut-down down the road. Each crew members plays a substantial role leading to the visualized output, which contributes to the roller-coaster ride to those onboard.

The established factor of a corporate came from the exact factor that the boat have went through the stage to become a ship. While transformations is necessary, most changes are settled. Things become routined and it bring stability to crew members onboard.

The idea that a startup is new and a corporate is established is a double-edged sword. If you are considering to join one or quit one, it is crucial to consider the nature of the company with your personal context.

Depends on your role given, your pursue at that stage of your career life, these elements will decide whether the nature of an entity is a value-add, or unfavourable environment for you.
