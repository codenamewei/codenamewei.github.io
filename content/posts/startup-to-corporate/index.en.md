## Introduction

The last few years has been a roller coaster ride. A year ago, I stepped away from a tech startup and entered a corporate which started back in 1923 (which marks 100 years in the coming 2023!). Being in the fast-paced of technology field, changes is the norm and embracing changes is the only way in moving forward.

With a year milestone after the transition, this article details the learning from the transition of a startup to an established corporate.

## The Analogy

Joining a company just like as getting on board on a boat(startup) or a ship(established corporate). Each entity heading towards one single direction at one times, with crew members onboard playing a role to achieve the common goal.

## 1. Problem of the same nature, but different spectrum

The spectrum of the chaos lies in the number of holes you have to fix at the same time

**The Boat(The Start Up)**

Continue from the analogy raised, being at a startup can felt like being at a boat with multiple holes at the same time. The ability to prioritize which hole to fix will decide whether the ship will stay afloat or sink into the deep blue sea. Everyday is a whole new day to prioritize and weigh which problem is more worth-solving. If you are an independent contributor, it ranges either to solve an existing bug or develop a new feature. If you are a team lead, it can be a presentation for a potential lead at 2 hours away or attend to an employee showing intention in quitting. If you are at a position of wearing multiple hats, which is very common in a startup, all of that is your problems.

**The Ship(The Established Corporate)**

Contrary to that, a ship which has stays afloat for decades and experienced countless number of tides, the number of holes of to fix at each time is relatively lesser. This is ultimately the differences between a startup and an established corporate. Most importantly, buisness achieve the stage with stabil monthly recurring revenue. Department and roles have been formed over the years to address different sets of concerns. Employees at the corporate have developed best known methods to tackle previously faced problems. New hires went through sessions of knowledge transfer to pick up skills needed to get work done. With prior knowledge, resources and skillful teams, the impacts of setbacks are reduces extensively.

## 2. Changes are bound to happen.

If it's not already obvious, both startup and established are context of the similar nature. The differences one might experience in a startup or an well-established corporate is just a matter of different spectrum, but not a total different set of reality.

**The Ship(The Established Corporate)**

Reorganization still happening, business changes especially with internal and external factors.

Internally, talent retention never gets easy, as clever people leave the company due to lack of opportunity to shine by working on high-profile projects or relate daily works to company's vision.

Externally, Covid disruptions (2019-2021) and the new norms of post-Covid (2022 onwards) changes the priority of the public and directly shifts the focus of the company.

What might be different is the magnitude of the impact and how people in the pool identify it at different paces. For example, people of corporate would able to foreseen problem at an earlier stage, and come collectively to either mitigate or solve the problem. The reason partly, if not all, when shit hits the fan, it's **shared accountability** and everybody gets affected. The impact might varies from getting a red card for performance review to how teams being dispensed due to the lost of projects.

The point is, problems of similar natures will keep on happening. At a point where you might wonder, did any company ever get this rights? Did any company able to build an stabil structure which only focuses on problems that worth solving?

## Final Word

Culture build from top down, never the other around. When the right leadership team has been build, it's all in the details to cascade to middle management team and build the right message to convey. It also does means that if you are at a place where you find that your beliefs, your daily way of working are largely different from the company's vision, it will be nearly impossible for you to create an overhaul to company's culture that goes through all tiers.

To build a company which lasts, you need a leadership team who cares for the right cause and business continues to evolve with market dynamics. The latter include identify market needs in advance, build good products, and build the positioning to right crowd.
