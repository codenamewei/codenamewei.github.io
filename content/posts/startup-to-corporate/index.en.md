### Nevertheless, the dynamics are still the same.

Reorganization still happening, business changes especially with internal and external factors.

Internally, talent retention never gets easy, as clever people leave the company due to lack of opportunity to shine by working on high-profile projects or relate daily works to company's vision.

Externally, Covid disruptions (2019-2021) and new norms of post-Covid (2022 onwards) changes the priority of the public and directly impacts the company's focus.

What might be different is the magnitude of the impact and how people in the pool able to identify it at different paces. For example, people of corporate would able to foreseen problem at an earlier stage, and come collectively to either mitigate or solve the problem. The reason partly, if not all, when shit hits the fan, it's shared accountability and everybody gets affected. The impact might varies from getting a red card for performance review to how teams being dispensed due to the lost of projects.

The point is, problems of similar natures will keep on happening. At a point where you might wonder, did any company get this rights? Did any company able to build an stabil structure which only focuses on problems that worth solving?

### Final Word

Culture build from top down, never the other way. When the right leadership team has been build, it's all in the details to cascade to middle management team and build the right message to convey.

It also does means that if you are at a place where you find that your beliefs, your daily way of working are largely different from the company's vision, it will be nearly impossible for you to create an overhaul to company's culture that goes through all tiers.

To build a company which lasts, you need a leadership team who cares for the right cause and business continues to evolve with market dynamics. The latter include identify market needs in advance, build good products, and build the positioning to right crowd.
